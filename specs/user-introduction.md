# Tarot Cards Introduction
***Tarot cards have long been used as a tool for divination, offering insights into one's past, present, and future. The Tarot deck is filled with symbolism and steeped in historical and mystical connotations, serving as a powerful mirror to your inner world and external circumstances.***

The deck you will be exploring comprises 22 Major Arcana cards, which carry profound meanings and themes. They speak to universal experiences and life cycles we all go through in our journey, from innocence and growth to wisdom and self-realization. They represent powerful archetypes, emotional states, and life events, guiding you towards a deeper understanding of your existence.

## How to use Tarot Cards step-by-step

### Step 1: Shuffling the Cards
Before you begin your reading, you need to shuffle the cards. This is done by clicking the `Shuffle Button` located at the center of the your Tarot page's screen. This process is designed to randomize the deck and ensure that the cards you pick are guided by your intuition and the synchronicity of the universe.

### Step 2: Choosing Your Cards
After shuffling, the deck will appear spread out on the screen. Now, it's time to pick your cards. To select a card, simply click on it. You should do this three times, each time focusing on a different aspect of time: *past, present,* and *future.*

- When selecting the first card, clear your mind
and focus on your *past* - the experiences and events that have shaped you.
- For the second card, shift your focus to your *present* situation - your current feelings, thoughts, and circumstances.
- When choosing the third card, think about your *future.* Visualize where you want to go or what you're curious about.

### Step 3: Reading Your Cards
Once you've selected all three cards, they will be revealed, and the interpretations for each will appear when you click on it. Each interpretation will provide insights into the different aspects of your life, shedding light on your journey. Take your time to read and absorb the messages from each card.

Remember, this is your personal reading and it is meant to offer guidance, not fixed answers. Always take what resonates with you and leave what does not. Trust your own intuition above all. Don't overthink, let your intuition guide you. 

Enjoy!
